          "Server accounts are specialized non-human identities that are created to facilitate the management, authentication, and authorization of server systems within an IT environment. These accounts are essential for various automated processes, enabling servers to communicate with each other and perform tasks without human intervention. Server accounts typically have specific permissions tailored to their functions, such as accessing databases, running applications, or performing system updates. Unlike user accounts, which are tied to individuals, server accounts are designed for services, applications, and systems, ensuring that they can operate effectively while maintaining security protocols. It is crucial to manage these accounts carefully to prevent unauthorized access or misuse, as they often have elevated privileges. Implementing best practices for server account management includes regular audits, password rotation, and the principle of least privilege to ensure that these accounts maintain their intended security posture.",

Although the term is typically associated with human data, it is important to consider its implications in systems that manage identities for non-human entities, such as machines or automated systems. PII encompasses a wide range of information, including names, addresses, social security numbers, and other identifiers that can link back to a specific person. When managing identities in a non-human context, it is crucial to ensure that any associated PII is handled with care to protect the privacy and security of individuals. This includes implementing robust data protection measures, ensuring compliance with regulations, and being transparent about data usage. Additionally, effective identity management systems should be designed to minimize the collection and retention of PII wherever possible, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.",

These factors can include something the entity knows (like a password), something the entity has (like a hardware token or a mobile device), or something the entity is (like biometric data). This layered approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, as it is much more difficult for attackers to compromise multiple authentication factors.

This promotes a more secure and flexible approach to access management. For instance, when an application needs to access a database, it can assume an IAM role that provides the necessary permissions to perform that task. The role can be configured with specific policies that define the actions allowed and the resources that can be accessed. This model also supports the principle of least privilege, ensuring that non-human entities only have access to the resources they need to perform their functions, and nothing more.

          "In the context of Non-Human Identity Management, delegation refers to the mechanism by which a user or an entity can assign certain rights and responsibilities to another non-human identity, such as an application, service, or automated system. This allows the delegated entity to perform specific actions or access resources on behalf of the user without needing to expose or share the user's credentials. Delegation is crucial in scenarios where automated processes handle tasks like data retrieval, resource management, or interaction with other services while maintaining security and compliance. It typically involves the use of tokens or certificates that define the scope and duration of the delegated authority. Properly implemented delegation helps enhance security by minimizing credential sharing and enabling better audit trails of actions performed by non-human identities. It also facilitates greater flexibility in managing digital services and workflows, as non-human entities can operate autonomously within defined limits.",

          "In the context of Non-Human Identity Management, 'Roles' are critical in organizing and managing the access and permissions of non-human entities, such as applications, services, devices, and automated processes. These roles help to delineate what actions a non-human entity can perform within a system, ensuring that security policies are enforced effectively. By assigning specific roles based on the needs of the entity, organizations can streamline access control, improve security posture, and simplify compliance with regulatory requirements. For example, a role may be designated for a data-processing application that allows it to read data from a database but not modify it. This principle of least privilege is essential for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of resources. Moreover, roles can be dynamic, allowing for adjustments based on context, such as time of day or operational state, which enhances flexibility in identity management strategies.",

This is crucial in preventing unauthorized access and ensuring that only legitimate entities can interact with systems and data. Various methods of authentication are employed, including API keys, digital certificates, OAuth tokens, and other cryptographic techniques. Unlike human authentication, which often relies on passwords or biometric data, non-human authentication focuses on establishing trust based on machine-readable credentials. This becomes increasingly important as the number of connected devices and automated systems grows in the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing environments. The proper implementation of authentication protocols ensures that non-human identities can be reliably validated, thereby safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining the integrity of digital transactions.",

These assertions are generated by a SAML identity provider (IdP) and can include information such as authentication status, authorization data, and attributes about the entity. Non-human identities often require secure, automated access to resources without user intervention, making SAML assertions a suitable mechanism for granting such access based on predefined criteria. By leveraging SAML assertions, organizations can implement Single Sign-On (SSO) across various services and streamline access management for non-human identities. This enhances security by ensuring that only authenticated and authorized entities can interact with sensitive systems, while also simplifying the management of access policies for diverse applications and services within an organization.",
